# Stage 0: Initialize Ideas

**Owner:** Business Owner  
**Attendances:** Product Manager

## Overview

This stage transforms the initial School Result Management System (SRMS) idea into professional project kickoff documentation. It defines the problem, target users, value proposition, and owner requirements that will guide all subsequent development stages.

## Project Classification

**Project Purpose:** P4 (Commercial/Profit-Oriented Product)  
**Development Scale:** L4 (Product MVP)

## Documentation in This Stage

### Core Documents
- [x] **README.md** - This file, stage overview and guide
- [x] **problem-statement.md** - Clear problem definition and constraints
- [x] **target-users.md** - Who has the problem (high-level), primary audience
- [x] **value-proposition.md** - Why this solution matters and core benefits
- [x] **owner-requirement.md** - Requirements from ideas.md + owner constraints
- [x] **cost-budget.md** - LLM token budget per stage and estimated USD cost

## Why These Documents?

Each document serves a specific purpose in ensuring the project starts with clear direction:

1. **problem-statement.md** - Articulates the core problem schools face with manual result management
2. **target-users.md** - Identifies schools, administrators, teachers, and students/parents as stakeholders
3. **value-proposition.md** - Defines how automation and accuracy provide competitive advantage
4. **owner-requirement.md** - Captures all feature requirements and constraints from the initial idea
5. **cost-budget.md** - CRITICAL: Estimates AI token usage and costs to ensure budget awareness before proceeding

## Next Steps

After completing this stage:
1. Review and approve all documentation
2. Review and approve the estimated budget in cost-budget.md
3. Proceed to Stage 1: Market Research (if budget approved)

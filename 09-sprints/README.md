# Stage 9: Sprint Development

**Owner:** Project Manager  
**Attendances:** All Development Roles (Frontend, Backend, QA, etc.)

## Overview

This is where AI-accelerated development happens. Features are broken into sprints, implemented, tested, and reviewed. Each sprint has its own folder with backlog items.

## Documentation to Create

- [ ] **sprint-feature-proposal.md** - Proposed sprint feature list for user approval before creating sprints

## Sprint Structure

Each sprint will have:
- Sprint folder (e.g., `user-auth/`, `grade-management/`, `pdf-generation/`)
- Sprint README with overview, status, and plan
- Backlog items with prefixes:
  - `FEATURE-*.md` - New feature request
  - `CHANGE-*.md` - Feature change request
  - `BUG-*.md` - Bug fix
  - `IMPROVE-*.md` - Improvement/refactor

## Proposed Sprint Breakdown

1. **user-auth** - Authentication and authorization
2. **grade-management** - Grade entry and management
3. **calculation-engine** - Auto position calculation and subject weighting
4. **pdf-generation** - Report card PDF export
5. **history-archive** - Term/session history viewing
6. **admin-features** - Admin override and audit trail
7. **ui-polish** - Responsive design and accessibility

## Next Steps

After completing this stage, proceed to Stage 10: Deployment

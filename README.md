## 🤖 What is AI Dev Swarm?

AI Dev Swarm is an AI-powered development framework designed to turn a simple idea into a full-stack, commercial-ready product — automatically.

No coding knowledge required.
No tech background needed.
Just an idea.

AI Dev Swarm guides you step by step through the entire product lifecycle.

AI handles everything.
You focus on vision and decisions.

Our goal is simple but ambitious:

Enable a one-person company to become real — powered by AI.

## How It Works

Fork and clone this project, then work with `Claude Code` and `OpenAI Codex` by default via Agent Skills integration.

For `Gemini CLI` or other AI Agents that do not support Agent skills natively, you can use them as an MCP server by configuring:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillz": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "skillz@latest",
        "/project-root-absolute-path/dev-swarms/skills",
        "--verbose"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Start with your ideas in `ideas.md`, then progress through structured stages:

**Planning & Strategy (Stages 0-4)**
- **Stage 0: Init Ideas** - Transform informal ideas into professional project documentation
- **Stage 1: Market Research** - Validate the problem and analyze competitive landscape
- **Stage 2: Personas** - Define user personas and prioritized user stories (P0/P1/P2)
- **Stage 3: MVP** - Define minimum viable product scope and success metrics
- **Stage 4: PRD** - Create comprehensive product requirements document

**Design & Architecture (Stages 5-7)**
- **Stage 5: UX Design** - Design user flows, interactions, and mockups
- **Stage 6: Architecture** - Define system components, data flow, and deployment boundaries
- **Stage 7: Tech Specs** - Specify tech stack, security, coding standards, and theme guidelines

**Development & Deployment (Stages 8-10)**
- **Stage 8: DevOps** - Setup development environment, GitHub, MCP tools, and Docker
- **Stage 9: Sprints** - AI-accelerated feature development with backlogs and testing
- **Stage 10: Deployment** - Deploy to staging/production with CI/CD pipelines

## Key Features

**Feature-Driven Development**
- Organize work into small, testable backlogs (feature/change/bug/improve)
- Maintain a features knowledge base for efficient context management
- Track progress through sprints with clear acceptance criteria

**AI-Powered Development Workflow**
- Specialized AI agents for each stage (Product Manager, Tech Architect, UX Designer, etc.)
- Code development, review, and testing automated with AI assistance
- Comprehensive documentation generated throughout the lifecycle

**Quality & Standards**
- Built-in code review and testing phases
- Security-first approach (OWASP, authentication, authorization)
- Conventional commits and structured git workflow
- End-user test plans for every sprint

## Repository Structure

See `dev-swarms/docs/repository-structure.md` for the complete folder structure and file organization.

## Getting Started

1. Create your initial ideas in `ideas.md`
2. Run the init-ideas skill to formalize your project documentation
3. Progress through each stage sequentially
4. Use AI agents to accelerate development and maintain quality

Each stage builds upon the previous, ensuring alignment from business goals through to implementation.

## Skills Available

- **init-ideas** - Project kickoff and idea formalization
- **market-research** - Market validation and competitive analysis
- **personas** - User personas and story creation
- **mvp** - MVP scope definition
- **prd** - Product requirements documentation
- **ux** - User experience design
- **architecture** - System architecture design
- **tech-specs** - Technical specifications
- **devops** - Development environment setup
- **project-management** - Sprint and backlog management
- **code-development** - Feature implementation
- **code-review** - Code quality review
- **code-test** - Comprehensive testing
- **deployment** - Production deployment
- **draft-commit-message** - Generate conventional commits

## Documentation

All project documentation is organized in numbered folders (00-10) representing each stage, with supporting documentation in `features/` for the knowledge base and `99-archive/` for completed work.

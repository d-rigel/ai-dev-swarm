## 🤖 What is AI Dev Swarm?

AI Dev Swarm is an AI-powered development framework designed to turn a simple idea into a full-stack, commercial-ready product — automatically.

No coding knowledge required.
No tech background needed.
Just an idea.

AI Dev Swarm guides you step by step through the entire product lifecycle.

AI handles everything.
You focus on vision and decisions.

Our goal is simple but ambitious:

Enable a one-person company to become real — powered by AI.

## Support

Discord support: https://juniorit.ai/virtual-office

## How It Works

Fork and clone this project, then work with AI Code Agent below by default via Agent Skills integration.

- `Claude Code`
- `OpenAI Codex`
- `GitHub Copilot CLI`
- `opencode`

For `Gemini CLI` or other AI Agents that do not support Agent skills natively, you can use them as an MCP server by configuring:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillz": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "skillz@latest",
        "/project-root-absolute-path/dev-swarms/skills",
        "--verbose"
      ]
    }
  }
}

// refer to `.gemini/settings.json`
```

📖 **New to AI Dev Swarm?** Check out the [Complete User Manual](USER-MANUAL.md) for a step-by-step guide designed for non-technical users.

Start with your ideas in `ideas.md`, then progress through structured stages:

**Planning & Strategy (Stages 0-4)**
- **Stage 0: Init Ideas** - Transform informal ideas into professional project documentation
- **Stage 1: Market Research** - Validate the problem and analyze competitive landscape
- **Stage 2: Personas** - Define user personas and prioritized user stories (P0/P1/P2)
- **Stage 3: MVP** - Define minimum viable product scope and success metrics
- **Stage 4: PRD** - Create comprehensive product requirements document

### Design & Architecture (Stages 5-7)
- **Stage 5: UX Design** - Design user flows, interactions, and mockups
- **Stage 6: Architecture** - Define system components, data flow, and deployment boundaries
- **Stage 7: Tech Specs** - Specify tech stack, security, coding standards, and theme guidelines

### Development & Deployment (Stages 8-10)
- **Stage 8: DevOps** - Setup development environment, GitHub, MCP tools, and Docker
- **Stage 9: Sprints** - AI-accelerated feature development with backlogs and testing
- **Stage 10: Deployment** - Deploy to staging/production with CI/CD pipelines

## Key Features (Planned)

- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Standard stdio transport for maximum compatibility
- **Automatic Skill Discovery**: Dynamically discovers and registers all dev-swarms skills
- **Context Injection**: Injects skill instructions into AI agent sessions
- **Smart Path Resolution**: Handles file paths relative to project root
- **Python + FastMCP**: Modern, reliable implementation with uv for dependency management

# [Backlog Title]

## Metadata

- **Backlog Type**: [FEATURE | CHANGE | BUG | IMPROVE]
- **Feature Name**: `[feature-name]` (CRITICAL: This is the index for all documentation and code)
- **Created By**: [Role1, Role2] (If this backlog relates to multiple roles, specify each role name)
- **Status**: [Not Started | In Development | In Code Review | In Testing | Done]
- **Sprint**: [sprint-name]
- **Estimated Size**: [~X lines of code] (MUST be ≤150 LOC per sprint-backlog-guidelines.md)

## Description

[Clear description of what needs to be done from the user's perspective]

**Size Constraint:** This backlog should be ≤150 lines of code (or equivalent logical scope). If it feels "big," split into smaller backlogs.

### Why This Work Is Needed

[Explain the business value, problem being solved, or reason for this work]

## Original Feature/Backlog (For CHANGE/BUG/IMPROVE types only)

Link to the original backlog that this backlog is modifying:
- [BACKLOG_TYPE-feature-name-sub-feature.md](BACKLOG_TYPE-feature-name-sub-feature.md)

## User Story (For FEATURE type only)

- As a [user role], I want [capability], So that [benefit/value].

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Reference Features

List related features from `features/features-index.md`:
- `[related-feature-name]` - Brief description of how it relates

## Test Plan (MANDATORY per sprint-backlog-guidelines.md)

**CRITICAL:** This backlog MUST specify at least one test method below. A backlog without a clear test method is not valid.

### Test Method(s) - Select at least one:
- [ ] **Unit Test**: [Describe what unit tests will verify]
- [ ] **UI Testing**: [Manual or automated - describe UI test steps]
- [ ] **Command-line Testing**: [curl commands, CLI tools, shell scripts]
- [ ] **Log Verification**: [What logs to check during runtime]

### Expected Behavior
[What behavior is expected when this backlog is complete]

### Test Success Criteria
[What result confirms the test passed]

### Manual Testing Steps (if applicable)
- Step 1: [Action to take]
- Step 2: [Expected result]
- Step 3: [Verify behavior]

### Automated Testing (if applicable)
- Unit tests: [What to test]
- Integration tests: [What to test]
- API tests: [Endpoints to test]

### Definition of Done
This backlog is considered **Done** only when its test method(s) pass.

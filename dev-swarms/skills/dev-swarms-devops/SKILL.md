# AI Builder - DevOps Setup

This skill sets up the development environment foundation, including local/cloud environment setup, MCP tools configuration, GitHub repository settings, and Docker/Dev Container configurations.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to setup devops or development environment
- User wants to configure GitHub repository
- User needs MCP tools setup for AI agent
- User wants Docker or Dev Container configuration
- Start Stage 8 after tech specs are defined
- When `git remote -v` shows no remote repository linked

## Your Roles in This Skill

- **DevOps Engineer**: Setup and configure development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment infrastructure. Identify the best local or cloud development setup based on project requirements and ensure all tools are properly configured for AI agent usage.
- **Infrastructure Architect**: Design and implement scalable, secure infrastructure solutions. Make decisions on containerization, environment isolation, and development workflow optimization.

## Role Communication

As an expert in your assigned roles, you must announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

- As a DevOps Engineer, I will assess current environment and identify required MCP tools and configurations
- As a Infrastructure Architect, I will design development container configuration with appropriate tools and dependencies
- As a DevOps Engineer, I will create setup plan files for GitHub repository, MCP tools, and dev containers
- As a DevOps Engineer, I will ask user to confirm setup plans before executing any configuration changes
- As a DevOps Engineer, I will execute setup tasks and fix any errors encountered during configuration
- As a DevOps Engineer, I will verify all setups are working and update documentation to reflect actual environment

This communication pattern ensures transparency and allows for human-in-the-loop oversight at key decision points.

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 0: Verify Prerequisites and Gather Context

1. **Check if `07-tech-specs/` folder exists (mandatory):**
   - If NOT found: Inform user they need to define tech specs first, then STOP
   - If found: Read all files to understand:
     - Technology stack chosen
     - Development tools needed
     - Infrastructure requirements

2. **Check if `00-init-ideas/` folder exists (recommended):**
   - If found: Read to understand:
     - Cost budget (to understand constraints for this stage)

3. **Check if this stage should be skipped:**
   - Check if `08-devops/SKIP.md` exists
   - **If SKIP.md exists:**
     - Read SKIP.md to understand why this stage was skipped
     - Inform the user: "Stage 8 (devops) is marked as SKIP because [reason from SKIP.md]"
     - Ask the user: "Would you like to proceed to the next stage (sprints)?"
     - **If user says yes:**
       - Exit this skill and inform them to run the next stage skill
     - **If user says no:**
       - Ask if they want to proceed with devops anyway
       - If yes, delete SKIP.md and continue with this skill
       - If no, exit the skill

4. **Check if `08-devops/` folder exists:**
   - If exists: Read all existing files to understand current state
   - If NOT exists: Will create new structure

5. **Assess Current Environment:**
   - Run `git remote -v` to check if remote repository is linked
   - Check if `.git` directory exists
   - Look for existing MCP tools configuration
   - Check for `.devcontainer/` folder
   - Check for `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`

6. **Analyze Project Requirements:**
   - Based on the tech stack (from `07-tech-specs/`), determine if project needs:
     - Local development only
     - Cloud development environment
     - Containerized development
     - Specific MCP tools (Playwright, GitHub, AWS, etc.)
   - Identify complexity level:
     - **Basic**: Simple projects with minimal setup
     - **Standard**: Projects requiring GitHub + basic MCP tools
     - **Complex**: Projects requiring full cloud setup, multiple MCP tools, advanced Docker configurations

7. Proceed to Step 1 with gathered context

### Step 1: Refine Design Requirements in README and Get Approval

**CRITICAL: Create/update README.md first based on previous stage results, get user approval, then create setup plan files.**

1. **Analyze information from previous stages:**
   - Read `07-tech-specs/` to understand technology stack and tools
   - Consider cost-budget constraints for this stage
   - Assess current environment status

2. **Create or update 08-devops/README.md with refined requirements:**
   - **Stage overview and objectives** (based on previous stage context)
   - **Owners:** DevOps Engineer (lead), Infrastructure Architect
   - **What devops setup will include:**
     - GitHub repository setup (if needed)
     - MCP tools configuration (list which tools)
     - Development container setup (if needed)
     - CI/CD pipeline configuration (if applicable)
   - **Methodology:**
     - How environment will be configured
     - What tools will be installed
   - **Deliverables planned:**
     - List of files that will be created (github-setup.md, mcp-setup.md, etc.)
   - **Budget allocation for this stage** (from cost-budget.md)
   - **Status:** In Progress (update to "Completed" after implementation)

3. **Present README to user:**
   - Show the devops approach and what will be configured
   - Show what setup files will be created
   - Explain how it aligns with previous stages and tech stack
   - Ask: "Does this devops setup plan look good? Should I proceed with creating setup configurations?"

4. **Wait for user approval:**
   - **If user says yes:** Proceed to Step 2
   - **If user says no:**
     - Ask what needs to be changed
     - Update README based on feedback
     - Ask for approval again

### Step 2: Create Setup Plan Files

**Only after user approves the README:**

**IMPORTANT:** The file structure below is a SAMPLE only. The actual files you create must follow what was approved in the README.md in Step 1.

**These files serve dual purposes:**
1. **Initially**: Setup plans/instructions for user approval
2. **Finally**: Documentation of the actual environment (source of truth for future reset/update)

1. **Create files as specified in the approved README.md:**

   **Typical structure (example):**
   ```
   08-devops/
   ├── README.md (already created and approved in Step 1)
   ├── github-setup.md (if specified in README)
   ├── mcp-setup.md (if specified in README)
   └── vscode-devcontainer.md (if specified in README)
   ```

   **Create only the files listed in the README's "Deliverables planned" section.**

2. **Create setup plan files with proposed configurations:**

**NOTE:** The content structure below provides GUIDELINES for typical devops setup files. Adapt based on the approved README and project needs.

**github-setup.md (if specified in README - Setup Plan):**
Write as a setup plan with:
- Proposed GitHub repository settings
- Branch protection rules to be configured
- PR template to be created
- GitHub Actions workflows (if applicable)
- Issue templates (if needed)
- Repository permissions plan
- Clear step-by-step setup instructions

**mcp-setup.md (Setup Plan):**
Write as a setup plan with:
- List of MCP tools to be installed/configured
- Installation steps for each MCP tool
- Configuration details (file locations, settings)
- Required environment variables and credentials
- Permission requirements
- Test commands to verify each tool
- Clear step-by-step setup instructions

**vscode-devcontainer.md (Setup Plan):**
Write as a setup plan with:
- Dev Container configuration to be created
- Dockerfile contents
- docker-compose.yml contents (if needed)
- VS Code extensions to install
- Environment variables to set
- Port forwarding configuration
- Volume mounts specification
- Post-create commands
- Clear step-by-step setup instructions

### Step 3: Get User Confirmation

2. Explain what will be configured/installed
3. Ask user to review and confirm before proceeding
4. Make any adjustments based on user feedback
5. **DO NOT PROCEED** until user explicitly confirms

### Step 4: Execute Setup Tasks

**ONLY AFTER USER CONFIRMATION**, execute each setup:

1. **Execute GitHub Setup:**
   - Follow steps in `github-setup.md`
   - If no remote: Guide/help user create GitHub repository
   - Link local repository to remote using `git remote add`
   - Create branch protection rules (via GitHub CLI or web)
   - Create PR templates in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Create issue templates if specified
   - **Fix any errors encountered during setup**
   - Retry failed steps with corrections

2. **Execute MCP Tools Setup:**
   - Follow steps in `mcp-setup.md`
   - Install/configure each MCP tool specified
   - Setup required credentials and environment variables
   - Create/update MCP configuration files
   - Test each MCP tool connectivity
   - **Fix any errors encountered during setup**
   - Retry failed steps with corrections
   - Document any manual steps user needs to complete

3. **Execute Dev Container Setup:**
   - Follow steps in `vscode-devcontainer.md`
   - Create `.devcontainer/` folder
   - Create `devcontainer.json` with specified configuration
   - Create `Dockerfile` with specified contents
   - Create `docker-compose.yml` if specified
   - Build container to test
   - **Fix any errors encountered during setup**
   - Retry failed steps with corrections
   - Fix Dockerfile or configuration issues as needed

### Step 5: Verification and Testing

For each completed setup:

1. **Verify GitHub setup:**
   - Run `git remote -v` to confirm remote is linked
   - Check branch protection rules are applied
   - Verify PR templates exist and are formatted correctly
   - Test creating a test PR (if applicable)

2. **Verify MCP tools:**
   - Test each configured MCP tool with simple commands
   - Ensure AI agent can access MCP tools
   - Verify permissions are correctly set
   - Check environment variables are loaded
   - Document any issues or limitations

3. **Verify Dev Container:**
   - Successfully build container without errors
   - Start container and verify it runs
   - Check all specified tools/extensions are available
   - Test volume mounts work correctly
   - Verify port forwarding is configured
   - Test development workflow inside container

### Step 6: Update Documentation Files

**CRITICAL**: Update all setup files to reflect actual environment:

1. **Update github-setup.md:**
   - Change from "setup plan" to "current configuration"
   - Document actual repository URL, settings applied
   - Document actual branch protection rules in place
   - Note any deviations from original plan
   - Add verification results
   - Add troubleshooting notes for any issues encountered

2. **Update mcp-setup.md:**
   - Change from "setup plan" to "current configuration"
   - Document actual MCP tools installed and versions
   - Document actual configuration file locations and contents
   - Document actual environment variables set
   - Add verification results
   - Add troubleshooting notes for any issues encountered
   - Document how to reset/reinstall each tool

3. **Update vscode-devcontainer.md:**
   - Change from "setup plan" to "current configuration"
   - Document actual container configuration
   - Add notes about successful build settings
   - Document any modifications made during setup
   - Add verification results
   - Add troubleshooting notes for any issues encountered
   - Document how to rebuild/reset the container

4. **Update 08-devops/README.md:**
   - Update current environment status to "Configured"
   - Add summary of what was set up
   - Add links to verification results
   - Note date of setup completion

**These updated files now serve as the source of truth for:**
- Future environment resets
- Environment updates
- Onboarding new team members
- Debugging environment issues

### Step 7: Final User Review

1. **Inform user that devops setup is complete**
2. **Update README.md:**
   - Change **Status** from "In Progress" to "Completed"
   - Add a **Summary** section with key insights (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Add a **Created Files** section listing all created files

3. **Present completed work to user:**
   - Show the updated documentation showing actual configuration
   - Show verification results for all setups
   - Confirm everything is working as expected

4. Ask if they want to proceed to `09-sprints/` (next stage)
5. Make any final adjustments based on user feedback if needed

### Step 8: Commit to Git

1. **Ask user if they want to commit the setup:**
   - Stage all changes in `08-devops/`
   - Stage `.devcontainer/` files (if created)
   - Stage `.github/` files (if created)
   - Stage any configuration files (MCP configs, etc.)
   - Commit with message: "Setup DevOps environment and configurations"

2. **Optionally push to remote** (if GitHub was set up)

## Expected Output Structure

```
project-root/
├── 08-devops/
│   ├── README.md (with owner and attendances)
│   ├── github-setup.md
│   ├── mcp-setup.md
│   └── vscode-devcontainer.md
├── .devcontainer/ (if applicable)
│   ├── devcontainer.json
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── docker-compose.yml (optional)
└── .github/ (if GitHub setup)
    ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
    └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ (optional)
```

## Key Principles

- **Dual-purpose documentation**: Setup files serve as both initial plans and final documentation
- **Get confirmation first**: Always get user approval before executing setup tasks
- **Fix errors proactively**: When errors occur during setup, fix them and retry automatically
- **Update documentation**: After execution, update files to reflect actual environment state
- **Source of truth**: Final documentation becomes the authoritative reference for environment reset/update
- Identify the right level of complexity for the project
- Setup should enable AI agent to work autonomously
- All configurations should be version-controlled
- Security and permissions should be properly configured
- Development environment should be reproducible
- MCP tools should be tested and verified
- Documentation should be clear for both humans and AI agents

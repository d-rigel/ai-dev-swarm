When creating sprints and backlogs, the project manager should follow the rules defined in `dev-swarms/docs/sprint-backlog-guidelines.md` (by including this file in the skill.md file, so we can update the rules at any time).

Update dev-swarms/skills/dev-swarms-project-management/templates/* to make them clear and meet these requirements.

The development steps for each backlog are:

1. Developer writes code
2. Code review is performed
3. Testing is conducted

Each step should update/log the related backlog.md and sprint.md files.


Backlog.md file name format: [backlog-type]-[feature-name]-<sub-feature>.md

Ideally, each backlog is for a feature, but for large features that are hard to split, we can use sub-features. However, in `features/`, we manage all sub-features as one feature.

Since we will use `feature-name` to create the AI knowledge base in `features/`,

each backlog.md should contain the related `feature-name`, so the AI developer can quickly identify the code logic by referencing `features/`. In this way, the AI developer can work on a large project without needing to read all the code and docs at once.

Here are the steps for each role:

### Developer & Reviewer
1. Read backlog.md
2. Find the related `feature-name`
3. Read `features/features-index.md` from `features/` and find the feature file
4. Read other files related to this feature under contracts/flows/impl with the same `feature-name` file name
5. Check code in `src/` by referencing `features/impl/feature-name.md`
6. Write the code or review the code
7. Update the `backlog.md` file

### Tester
1. Read backlog.md for testing instructions
2. Find the related `feature-name`
3. Read `features/features-index.md` from `features/` and find the feature file
4. Read other files related to this feature under contracts/flows/impl with the same `feature-name` file name
5. Check code in `src/` by referencing `features/impl/feature-name.md`
6. Write test code or perform other testing without writing code
7. Update the `backlog.md` file with a test result summary

**We call this the feature-driven development pattern, where `feature-name` serves as the index for the whole project. AI developers/project managers use `feature-name` to manage the entire development lifecycle.**

The knowledge base `features/` is managed by developers and used by testers and reviewers. The project manager does not use or check the knowledge base `features/`; they use `feature-name` to connect each backlog to the knowledge base `features/`.

The knowledge base `features/` serves as the AI developer's memory. The Project Manager creates features/backlogs from a user level or non-technical level and doesn't need to care about how the whole structure of the project's code is organized in the codebase.

Add a new file `source-code-structure.md` to define the source code structure under the `src/` folder in the file `dev-swarms/docs/repository-structure.md`.

Update `dev-swarms/skills/dev-swarms-tech-specs` to include this file.

AI developers should follow `source-code-structure.md` to create and manage code in the `src/` folder.

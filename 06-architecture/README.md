# Stage 6: System Architecture

**Owner:** Tech Manager (Architect)  
**Attendances:** Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, Database Administrator

## Overview

This stage defines the system's shape and structure - how components fit together, how data flows, and where deployment boundaries exist. This is still technology-agnostic (frameworks chosen in Stage 7).

## Documentation to Create

- [ ] **system-overview.md** - Major components and their responsibilities
- [ ] **architecture-diagram.md** - System architecture diagram (Mermaid or image)
- [ ] **data-flow.md** - Request/data flow across frontend/backend/database/external services
- [ ] **deployment-boundaries.md** - Local vs cloud boundaries, trust zones, scaling assumptions

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. Frontend architecture (SPA vs MPA)
2. Backend API design (REST vs GraphQL)
3. Database design (schema, relationships)
4. Authentication/authorization strategy
5. File storage for PDFs
6. Caching strategy
7. Scalability approach

## Next Steps

After completing this stage, proceed to Stage 7: Technical Specifications

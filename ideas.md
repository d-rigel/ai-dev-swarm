# Ideas

This is the starting point for your AI-powered development project.

## Purpose

This file serves as the "start engine" of the AI builder. Document your initial ideas, problems you want to solve, and vision for your project here.

## How to Use

1. Write down your project ideas in plain language
2. Describe the problem you're trying to solve
3. Outline who your target users are
4. Share any requirements or constraints

The AI will use this as the foundation to guide you through the development process, from market research to deployment.

# Ideas (Draft)

This is the starting point for an AI-assisted project kickoff. Keep it rough, honest, and incomplete. You and the AI agent will iterate together to refine it into professional documentation.

## How We’ll Brainstorm Together

- You write quick, imperfect notes
- The AI proposes clearer structure, gaps, and options
- You confirm, correct, or add details
- We repeat until it is ready for formal stages

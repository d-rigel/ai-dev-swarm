# School Result Management System (SRMS)

## Problem

Managing student grades manually is time-consuming, prone to calculation errors, and makes it difficult to track long-term academic progress across different terms and sessions.

## Solution

A centralized digital platform that automates grading logic, ranks students based on performance, and generates professional, downloadable report cards while maintaining strict administrative control.

## Users

Both public and private schools (Administrators, Teachers, and Students/Parents).

## Features I Want

- **Custom Grading Scale:** Ability to define specific grade boundaries (e.g., A=75-100 or A=80-100) per department or level.
- **Auto Position Calculation:** The system must automatically rank students within a class or subject based on their total scores.
- **Subject Weighting:** Support for different score weights (e.g., Continuous Assessment = 30%, Exams = 70%).
- **PDF Result Export:** Generate clean, print-ready report cards for students to download.
- **Term/Session History:** A robust archive to view and compare results from previous years or terms.
- **Admin Override:** A high-level permission feature allowing administrators to manually adjust scores or settings if errors are found after submission.
- Please consider a very good user experience and accessibility and responsive design perfect for devices

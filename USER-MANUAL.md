## Understanding the 11-Stage Journey

AI Dev Swarm breaks product development into 11 clear stages. Each stage builds on the previous one.

### The Big Picture

**Think of it like building a house:**

- Stages 0-4: Planning (blueprints, permits, budgets)
- Stages 5-7: Design (architecture, materials, layout)
- Stages 8-10: Building (construction, finishing, move-in)

---

### Stage 0: Init Ideas

**What happens:** Transform your rough ideas into professional documentation

**AI asks you about:**

- What problem are you solving?
- Who has this problem?
- Why does your solution matter?
- How much are you willing to spend? (in AI processing costs)

**You get:**

- Clear problem statement
- Target user description
- Value proposition
- Project classification (how big is this?)
- Budget estimate

**Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Your involvement:** Answer questions, approve the documents

**Example output:**

```
00-init-ideas/
├── README.md (overview)
├── problem-statement.md (the problem you're solving)
├── target-users.md (who you're building for)
├── value-proposition.md (why it matters)
├── owner-requirement.md (your specific requirements)
└── cost-budget.md (estimated AI processing costs)
```

---

**Your involvement:** Confirm user profiles match your vision

**Example user story:**

```
As a homeowner, I want to post a repair job quickly,
so that I can get help within 24 hours.
Priority: P0 (critical for MVP)
```

---

### Stage 3: MVP Definition

**What happens:** Decide the smallest version that works

**MVP = Minimum Viable Product**
The simplest version you can launch to test your idea with real users.

**AI helps you:**

- Define what MUST be in the first version
- Explicitly exclude features for later
- Set success metrics

**You get:**

- MVP scope (what's included)
- Out-of-scope list (what's NOT included)
- Success metrics (how you'll measure success)

**Time:** 20-30 minutes
**Your involvement:** Make decisions about what's essential

**Critical thinking:**

- What's the absolute minimum users need?
- What can wait until version 2?
- How will you know if it's working?

---

### Stage 4: Product Requirements (PRD)

**What happens:** Lock down WHAT the product does (not HOW)

**AI documents:**

- Every feature in detail
- How features should behave
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Compliance needs

**You get:**

- Complete PRD document

## How to Work with AI Agents

### Understanding Agent Skills

**What are agent skills?**
Think of them as specialized AI assistants. Each skill is like hiring an expert for a specific job.

**Available skills (your AI team):**

| Skill Name                      | What They Do                               | When to Use                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `dev-swarms-init-ideas`         | Business analyst who organizes your ideas  | Starting a new project        |
| `dev-swarms-market-research`    | Market researcher who analyzes competitors | Validating your market        |

### How AI Communicates

AI agents announce their role before acting:

**Examples:**

```
As a Business Owner, I will create the problem statement...
As a Product Manager, I will define user stories...
As a Software Engineer, I will implement the login feature...
As a QA Tester, I will verify the authentication flow...
```

**Why this matters:**

- You know exactly what's happening
- You can stop and ask questions
- You understand who's doing what

---

### The Human-in-the-Loop Principle

**You are always in control:**

1. **AI proposes** → Creates a plan or document
2. **You review** → Check if it matches your vision
3. **You decide** → Approve, request changes, or reject
4. **AI executes** → Does the work only after your approval

**Critical approval points:**

- Before creating each stage's documentation
- Before writing code for each feature
- Before deploying to production
- When budget impacts are significant

---

### Cost and Budget Understanding

**AI processing costs money** (usually a few dollars to a hundred dollars depending on project size)

**Why budget matters:**

- Larger projects need more AI "thinking"
- Research takes more processing
- Testing uses AI resources

**Budget levels (examples):**

- L2 Tool: $2-$10
- L3 Single App: $10-$25
- L4 MVP: $25-$50
- L5 Multi-platform: $50-$100
- L6-L7 Large scale: $100+

**You approve the budget in Stage 0 - it constrains all future AI work**

---

## Slash Commands - Your Quick Actions

Slash commands are shortcuts to trigger specific actions. Think of them as quick buttons.

### Available Commands

**OpenAI Codex User**

> **Note:** OpenAI Codex does not support project-level slash commands natively. The workaround below creates a global symlink to enable these commands.

```bash
# For OpenAI Codex users: create a symlink to enable slash commands
# Note: All slash commands will use the `/prompts:command` format
ln -s /this-project-absolute-path/.claude/commands ~/.codex/prompts
```

#### `/stage [number or name]`

**Purpose:** Start or jump to a specific development stage

**Examples:**

```
/stage 0              → Start with init-ideas
/stage 1              → Start market research
/stage mvp            → Jump to MVP definition
/stage architecture   → Jump to architecture stage
```

**When to use:** Beginning a new stage or jumping to a specific stage

---

#### `/dev [backlog-name]`

**Purpose:** Develop a specific feature (code implementation only)

**Examples:**

```
/dev login            → Implement login feature
/dev user-profile     → Implement user profile feature
```

**When to use:** When you want AI to write code for a specific backlog

---

#### `/review [backlog-name]`

**Purpose:** Review code quality for a feature

**Examples:**

```
/review login         → Review login code
/review user-profile  → Review profile code
```

**When to use:** After development, to check code quality

---

#### `/test [backlog-name]`

**Purpose:** Test a feature thoroughly

**Examples:**

```
/test login           → Test login functionality
/test user-profile    → Test profile feature
```

**When to use:** After development and review, to verify it works

---

#### `/backlog [backlog-name]`

**Purpose:** Complete full workflow: develop → review → test

**Examples:**

```
/backlog login        → Full cycle for login
/backlog user-profile → Full cycle for profile
```

**When to use:** When you want complete end-to-end processing of a feature

**This is the most common command during development!**

---

### Command Workflow Example

**Scenario:** You want to build a user login feature

**Option 1: Step by step**

```
You: /dev login
[AI writes the code]

You: /review login
[AI reviews the code, finds issues, creates bug backlogs]

You: /test login
[AI tests thoroughly, creates more bug/improve backlogs if needed]
```

**Option 2: All at once**

```
You: /backlog login
[AI does all three steps automatically]
```

**Recommendation:** Use `/backlog` for most features. It's faster and ensures nothing is skipped.

### Key Folders Explained

**Planning Folders (00-04):**
These contain documents describing WHAT you're building. No code here.

**Design Folders (05-07):**
These describe HOW it works from user and system perspectives.

**Development Folders (08-10):**
This is where AI sets up tools and builds your product.

**features/ - The Knowledge Base:**
AI creates a "memory" here. Each feature is documented so AI can reference it later without re-reading all code.

**src/ - Your Code:**
The actual working software lives here.

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small

**Don't:**
"I want to build the next Facebook"

**Do:**
"I want a simple social network for my college dorm"

**Why:** Smaller projects finish faster and teach you the process.

---

### 2. Be Specific in ideas.md

**Don't:**
"A productivity app"

**Do:**
"A todo list app where tasks are organized by energy level (high, medium, low) so I can pick tasks based on how I feel"

**Why:** Specific ideas lead to better AI suggestions.

---

### 3. Review Everything AI Creates

AI is smart but not perfect. Always review:

- Does this match my vision?
- Did AI misunderstand anything?
- Are the features what I want?

**Don't blindly approve - read and think**

---

### 4. Test Features As They're Built

Don't wait until the end. Test each feature when it's done.

**Example:**

```
You: /backlog user-login

AI: Login feature is complete!

You: How do I test it?

AI: Run the app and try these steps...
[You test it immediately]
```

---

### 5. Ask Questions

AI can explain anything in simple terms.

**Good questions:**

- "Why did you choose PostgreSQL over MySQL?"
- "Can you explain this architecture in simple terms?"
- "What does this error mean?"
- "How much will hosting cost approximately?"

---

### 6. Use Git Commits

Save your progress regularly.

```
You: Let's commit this stage

AI: [Creates professional commit message]
[Saves your work to GitHub]
```

**Why:** You can always go back if something goes wrong.

---

### 7. Budget for Iterations

Your first version won't be perfect. Plan for:

- MVP (version 1)
- Improvements based on user feedback (version 2)
- New features (version 3+)

---

### 8. Understand the Difference Between Stages

**Planning stages (0-4):** Can change easily, just documents
**Implementation (9+):** Changes are harder, requires recoding

**Do lots of planning, then build once**

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Do I really need zero coding knowledge?**
A: Yes! But you'll learn concepts along the way. You don't need to write code, but you'll understand how software is built.

**Q: How long does a project take?**
A:

- Simple script (L0-L1): Few hours
- Tool (L2): 1-2 days
- Small app (L3): 1 week
- MVP (L4): 2-4 weeks
- Large product (L5+): 1-3 months

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Mostly your time. AI processing costs:

- L2: $2-$10
- L3: $10-$25
- L4: $25-$50
- L5+: $50-$200

Plus hosting costs when you deploy (varies by service).

**Q: Can I change my mind mid-project?**
A: Yes, but:

- Early stages (0-7): Easy to change
- During development (9): Harder, may need to redo code
- After deployment (10): Requires new development cycle

**Q: What if AI makes a mistake?**
A:

1. You review everything before approval
2. Code review catches issues
3. Testing finds bugs
4. You can always ask AI to fix it

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: What AI tools work with this?**
A:

- Claude Code (recommended)
- OpenAI Codex (works great)
- Gemini CLI (via MCP server configuration)
- Any AI that supports Agent Skills or MCP

**Q: Where does my code run?**
A:

- During development: On your computer
- After deployment: On cloud servers (AWS, etc.)

**Q: Do I need to learn Git?**
A: Basic Git helps but AI handles most of it. Learn these commands:

- `git status` (see changes)
- `git add .` (stage changes)
- `git commit -m "message"` (save changes)
- `git push` (upload to GitHub)

**Q: Can I use my own tech stack?**
A: Yes! In Stage 7, discuss with AI. It will explain tradeoffs.

**Q: What if I want to add features later?**
A: Just create new backlogs:

1. Add to `09-sprints/sprint-new/FEATURE-new-thing.md`
2. Run `/backlog new-thing`
3. Deploy update

---

### Process Questions

**Q: Can I skip stages?**
A: Depends on project size:

- L0-L1: Only need stage 0
- L2: Can skip 1, 5, 6, 10
- L3+: Should do all stages

AI will tell you which stages to skip.

**Q: What if I don't understand something AI created?**
A: Ask!

```
You: Can you explain the architecture in simple terms?
You: Why did you make this decision?
You: What does this mean for non-technical people?
```

**Q: How do I know if my idea is good?**
A: Stage 1 (market research) helps validate this. AI will:

- Find similar products
- Identify if there's demand
- Show you the competition

**Q: Can I work with a team?**
A: Yes! You can:

- Share the GitHub repository
- Work on different features simultaneously
- Review each other's backlogs

---

### Business Questions

**Q: Can I sell the product AI builds?**
A: Yes! It's your code. You own it.

**Q: Is it production-ready?**
A: For L4+ projects with full stages, yes. AI builds:

- Secure code
- Tested features
- Scalable architecture
- Proper deployment

**Q: How do I get users?**
A: AI builds the product. Marketing is up to you:

- Stage 1 gives you market insights
- Use that to find your audience
- Launch on relevant platforms

**Q: Can this replace hiring developers?**
A: For MVPs and small products: Often yes
For large-scale or highly specialized: You'll still benefit from experts
Best use: Validate ideas before hiring a team
